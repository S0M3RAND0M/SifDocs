= Difficulty Tuner

=== Features

==== Phase 1 Tractor Unlock

Instead of reaching Phase 2 the player can now unlock the milestone in Phase 1, something which might seem more balanced and also helps if the player uses Difficulty Tuner in order to make the game more challenging as a good wheeled logistics more or less becomes mandatory.

==== Pre-unlocked Foundations and Logistics

Player starts with Base Building and Logistics milestones already unlocked.

==== Slug Respawn

Random respawn for all slugs in the game world, they are no longer permanently gone when picked up but respawn on a timer between 7 to 30 in-game day after being picked up.

==== Blade Runners recipe removal

The MAM research for Blade Runners is still there but it is no longer available at the Workshop.

==== Machine Parts
